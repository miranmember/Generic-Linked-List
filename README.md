# Generic-Linked-List
This project is an implementation of a generic linked list in Java, as well as a queue and stack data structures built on top of the linked list. The linked list has the ability to store any data type and includes several methods such as adding elements, deleting elements, printing the contents of the list, dumping the list into an array, getting an element at a specific index, and setting an element at a specific index. The linked list also implements the Iterable interface, allowing it to be used in a for-each loop.

The queue data structure includes the following additional methods:

void enqueue(T data): adds an element to the end of the queue.
+ T dequeue(): removes and returns the first element of the queue.
+ T removeTail(): removes and returns the last element of the queue.
+ The stack data structure includes the following additional methods:

void push(T data): adds an element to the top of the stack.
+ T pop(): removes and returns the top element of the stack.
+ T removeTail(): removes and returns the bottom element of the stack.


# Getting Started
To use the linked list, queue, or stack in your project, simply import the GenericList, GenericQueue, and GenericStack classes. You can then create an instance of the linked list, queue, or stack and start using its methods.
